Slap: Same Numbers Only Variant

Get a standard deck of 52 cards and a table;
Determine number of players;
WHILE (cards are not spread evenly to each player)
  DO keep spreading cards to each player evenly;
Card information are kept hidden from other players;
Determine which player initiates start of round and which way players take turns;//u need to set this becuase remember that the game is played on a computer so u determine p1,p2,etc
Player that initiates round starts by placing one card face up in the middle of table without looking at card information;
WHILE (start player plays card)
  DO each player takes their turn playing their card until an identical number is revealed, regardless of color and group;
IF (card with identical number is placed together)
  THEN the first player to slap the pile of cards with their hand will take every card adding it to their deck;
  ELSE continue with game;
IF (player obtains all 52 cards)
  THEN player that obtains all cards wins the round;
  ELSE continue with game;
//this may be harder to implement also u should assign SLAP to a key.
//P.S i have no idea whether u are implementing or not.
